## 👥 Facilitation Tips

### Before Each Lab

**Set Context** (3 minutes):
- Explain why this skill matters
- Reference Investigation Guide section
- Show real-world example
- Set success criteria

**Example Script** (Lab 103):
> "In Lab 103, we're learning SessionId tracing - the gold standard for authentication forensics. When Identity Protection flags an impossible travel alert, you need to determine if it's a compromised account or a false positive. SessionId lets you trace the ENTIRE authentication chain to find the exact moment of initial login. This is covered in Section 9 of the Investigation Guide. By the end, you'll be able to definitively say 'this user was compromised' or 'this was legitimate travel.'"

### During Each Lab

**Monitor Progress**:
- Walk around (or monitor screen shares in virtual)
- Check for common blockers (date range errors, MCP connection issues)
- Encourage paired programming (2 analysts per machine)
- Celebrate wins ("Great! You found the SessionId!")

**Use Checkpoints**:
- Pause at each "Checkpoint" in lab guides
- Ask: "Who got X result?" (show of hands)
- Troubleshoot as group if <80% pass checkpoint
- Don't move forward until most participants ready

**Time Management**:
- Labs have target durations, but be flexible
- If behind: Skip optional exercises, focus on core concepts
- If ahead: Add challenges ("Now try finding IPs for this other user")
- Always preserve time for debrief

### After Each Lab

**Debrief** (5 minutes):
- Ask: "What was the key takeaway?"
- Clarify common mistakes
- Link to next lab: "In Lab 104, we'll use these queries for threat hunting"
- Take questions

### Common Mistakes to Watch For

**Lab 101**:
- ❌ Forgetting to add +2 days to date range
- ❌ Not activating Python virtual environment
- ✅ Fix: Show date calculator clearly, demo `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

**Lab 102**:
- ❌ Skipping User ID retrieval (Phase 1)
- ❌ Not checking if JSON already exists
- ✅ Fix: Emphasize workflow rules from Investigation Guide

**Lab 103**:
- ❌ Using wrong SessionId (picking random one vs suspicious IP's)
- ❌ Interpreting last event as initial auth (should be first!)
- ✅ Fix: Draw timeline on whiteboard showing first = auth, rest = tokens

**Lab 201**:
- ❌ Not tracking which user is which (violetm vs u3498 vs u11317)
- ❌ Skipping post-compromise analysis (stopping at click tracking)
- ✅ Fix: Create participant table: User | Click Time | First Suspicious IP

**Lab 106 (Microsoft Learn)**: 🆕
- ❌ Not understanding when to use docs_search vs code_sample_search
- ❌ Forgetting to specify language parameter for code samples
- ✅ Fix: Demo both tools side-by-side, emphasize language filtering

## 🎯 Engagement Strategies

### Interactive Techniques

**Think-Pair-Share**:
1. Pose question: "What does impossible travel mean?"
2. Give 1 min to think individually
3. Pair up, discuss 2 mins
4. Share with group

**Live Polling**:
- Use Slido or Teams polls
- "Which severity would you assign this incident? High/Medium/Low"
- Discuss why answers differ

**Hot Seat Rotation**:
- Rotate who's "driving" the screen share
- Each person executes one query, explains to group
- Builds confidence in speaking technical language

**Capture The Flag (CTF) Style**:
- Hide "flags" in lab data (e.g., "Find the attacker's email address")
- First person to find it explains how
- Gamifies learning

### Handling Questions

**Tactical Questions** ("How do I fix this error?"):
- Check error message against Investigation Guide Troubleshooting
- Demo fix on screen
- Have them retry

**Strategic Questions** ("Why SessionId vs just looking at IPs?"):
- Refer to Investigation Guide explanation
- Show example where IP-only would fail (token theft scenario)
- Connect to real incident

**Out-of-Scope Questions** ("Can this work with Splunk?"):
- Acknowledge question value
- Parking lot for offline discussion
- Stay focused on current lab

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide for Instructors

### Issue: MCP Server Not Connecting

**Symptoms**: `mcp_data_explorat_list_sentinel_workspaces` fails

**Quick Fixes**:
1. Check Azure AD authentication (re-login in VS Code)
2. Verify Sentinel workspace ID in config
3. Check participant has Security Reader role
4. Fallback: Use sample data from `labs/sample-data/`

### Issue: Date Range Returns No Results

**Symptoms**: Query executes but returns 0 rows

**Quick Fixes**:
1. Verify current date context (should be provided in lab)
2. Check +2 day rule applied correctly
3. Try broader range (14 days instead of 7)
4. Switch to sample data if production quiet

### Issue: Python Script Fails

**Symptoms**: `generate_report_from_json.py` crashes

**Quick Fixes**:
1. Check virtual environment activated
2. Verify all dependencies installed (`pip list`)
3. Check JSON format (valid syntax)
4. Fallback: Use pre-generated HTML report

### Issue: Participant Stuck, Blocking Progress

**Solutions**:
- Assign buddy to help while you continue with group
- Skip to next exercise, come back during break
- If widespread issue: Pause, demo solution, have all retry

## 💬 Sample Facilitation Scripts

### Opening Script (Full-Day Workshop)

> "Good morning everyone! Welcome to CyberProbe Deep Dive training. Over the next 8 hours, you're going to transform from CyberProbe beginner to confident investigator. We'll start with environment setup, progress through fundamental skills like SessionId tracing and threat hunting, and finish by investigating a realistic phishing campaign that compromised 3 users and exfiltrated 184 MB of financial data.
> 
> This is a hands-on workshop - you'll spend 90% of your time actually running queries and generating reports. I'm here to guide, troubleshoot, and answer questions, but the best learning happens when you're typing the KQL yourself.
> 
> Three ground rules: (1) Ask questions anytime - if you're confused, others probably are too. (2) Help each other - pair programming is encouraged. (3) Stay present - close email, focus on labs.
> 
> By end of day, you'll have completed your first full investigation and be ready to use CyberProbe in your SOC tomorrow. Let's get started with Lab 101..."

### Transition Script (Between Labs)

> "Great work on Lab 102! You just ran your first automated investigation. Key takeaway: Always check if JSON exists before re-querying - saves time and API costs.
> 
> In Lab 103, we're leveling up to SessionId tracing. This is the skill that separates good analysts from great ones. When you see an impossible travel alert, SessionId lets you say definitively whether it's a real compromise or just a VPN. We'll trace a complete authentication chain, identify the moment of initial login, and make a high-confidence risk assessment. This technique comes directly from Section 9 of the Investigation Guide.
> 
> Everyone ready? Let's dive in..."

### Microsoft Learn Integration Teaching Points 🆕

**When introducing Lab 106, Exercise 8:**

> "One of the biggest challenges in incident response is finding the RIGHT remediation procedures. You've all been there - Googling 'how to revoke OAuth app Azure AD', getting a mix of blog posts, Stack Overflow answers, and outdated Microsoft docs using deprecated cmdlets.
> 
> With the Microsoft Learn MCP Server, we're changing that workflow entirely. Instead of manually searching, you'll ask Copilot for remediation guidance and get official Microsoft documentation in seconds - always current, always authoritative, always production-ready.
> 
> Let me show you the difference..."

**Demo Script:**

1. **Show the old way** (2 minutes):
   - Open browser, Google "revoke OAuth application Azure AD"
   - Show mixed results: blogs, forums, old docs
   - Find Microsoft doc, but it references deprecated AzureAD module
   - "This is what we've all been doing - it works, but it's slow and error-prone"

2. **Show the new way** (2 minutes):
   - Open Copilot Chat in VS Code
   - Ask: "Show me PowerShell code to revoke malicious OAuth applications"
   - Watch as Copilot:
     - Searches Microsoft Learn automatically
     - Returns official Microsoft.Graph cmdlets
     - Includes documentation URLs for citation
   - "Same result in 10 seconds instead of 10 minutes, and guaranteed to be current"

3. **Explain the benefits** (1 minute):
   - ✅ **Speed**: 30-90x faster than manual research
   - ✅ **Accuracy**: Official Microsoft docs, not community interpretations
   - ✅ **Compliance**: Citable sources for audit reports
   - ✅ **Currency**: Always reflects latest security features
   - "This is especially valuable during active incidents - you can't afford to waste 15 minutes researching while an attacker is in your environment"

4. **Show integration** (2 minutes):
   - "During automated investigations, Copilot can automatically lookup remediation guidance"
   - "When it detects TOR IPs, it searches for Conditional Access blocking procedures"
   - "When it finds OAuth attacks, it retrieves official revocation playbooks"
   - "The generated reports include Microsoft Learn URLs - perfect for compliance documentation"

**Common Questions to Anticipate:**

**Q: "Does this require special API keys?"**
A: "No! Microsoft Learn is publicly accessible. The MCP Server is already configured in VS Code Copilot - no setup needed."

**Q: "What if I need docs for non-Microsoft products?"**
A: "This is specifically for Microsoft security products - Defender, Entra ID, Sentinel, Microsoft 365. For third-party tools, you'll still use traditional research methods."

**Q: "Can I trust the code samples to work in production?"**
A: "These come directly from Microsoft Learn documentation - they're production-tested by Microsoft. However, always test in a non-production environment first, especially for destructive operations like revoking access."

**Q: "What's the difference between docs_search and code_sample_search?"**
A: "Great question! 
- `docs_search`: Returns procedures, step-by-step guides, conceptual documentation
- `code_sample_search`: Returns executable code (PowerShell, KQL, Python) with language filtering
- Use docs_search first to understand WHAT to do, then code_sample_search to get the HOW (actual commands)"
