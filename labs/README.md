## 🛠️ Lab Environment Setup

### Initial Setup (Before Lab 101)

1. **Clone CyberProbe Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CyberProbe.git
   cd CyberProbe
   ```

2. **Create Python Virtual Environment**
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys** (if using threat intelligence)
   ```bash
   cp enrichment/config.json.template enrichment/config.json
   # Edit config.json with your API keys
   ```

4. **Verify MCP Server Access**
   - Ensure Sentinel MCP server is configured in VS Code
   - Test connection with `mcp_data_explorat_list_sentinel_workspaces`
