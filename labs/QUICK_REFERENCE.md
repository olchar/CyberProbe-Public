## 📊 Common Investigation Patterns

### Pattern 1: User Investigation (Standard 7-Day)

**When to use**: Routine security review, anomaly follow-up

**Prompt to Copilot**:
```
Investigate <user@domain.com> for the last 7 days
```

**Manual Steps**:
1. Get User ID from Graph: `/v1.0/users/<UPN>?$select=id,onPremisesSecurityIdentifier`
2. Run Sentinel queries (anomalies, sign-ins, audit logs, incidents)
3. Extract IPs → Run threat intel enrichment
4. Export to JSON
5. Generate HTML report

**Expected Time**: ~5-6 minutes

---

### Pattern 2: Incident Response (Quick 1-Day)

**When to use**: Active incident, urgent investigation

**Prompt to Copilot**:
```
Quick investigate <user@domain.com>
```

**Focuses on**: Last 24 hours only  
**Expected Time**: ~2-3 minutes

---

### Pattern 3: SessionId Authentication Tracing

**When to use**: Geographic anomalies, impossible travel, risky sign-ins

**Reference**: Investigation Guide Section 9

**Steps**:
1. Get SessionId from suspicious IP (Query 5 in Investigation Guide)
2. Trace complete authentication chain (Query 6)
3. Find first MFA event → This is initial authentication
4. Extract all IPs in session
5. Enrich IPs with threat intel
6. Document risk assessment

**Critical**: First event in SessionId chain = true authentication point

---

### Pattern 4: Phishing Investigation

**When to use**: Email-based attacks, credential theft

**Reference**: Lab 201, Investigation Guide Playbook 2

**Steps**:
1. Identify malicious emails (EmailEvents)
2. Track URL clicks (CloudAppEvents - SafeLinks)
3. Analyze post-click sign-ins
4. Use SessionId tracing for compromised accounts
5. Check post-compromise activity (forwarding rules, file access, DLP)
6. Generate remediation plan

**Expected Time**: 60-90 minutes for full investigation

---

### Pattern 5: Exposure & Posture Assessment

**When to use**: Security posture review, CTEM reporting, vulnerability prioritization

**Prompt to Copilot**:
```
What's our exposure posture? Show me choke points and critical vulnerabilities
```

**What happens** (automatically via `exposure-management` skill):
1. Queries `ExposureGraphNodes` / `ExposureGraphEdges` for attack surface topology
2. Identifies choke points (nodes with high blast radius)
3. Queries `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` for CVE inventory
4. Checks compliance posture via Azure Resource Graph (`securityresources`)
5. Renders inline visualizations (exposure graph, vuln dashboard, compliance gauges)

**Key Tables** (Advanced Hunting only — no `Timestamp` column):
```kql
// Choke point analysis
ExposureGraphNodes
| where isnotempty(NodeProperties)
| extend Props = parse_json(NodeProperties).rawData
| extend ExposureScore = todouble(Props.exposureScore)
| where ExposureScore > 50
| project NodeName, NodeLabel, ExposureScore
| order by ExposureScore desc
| take 20
```

```kql
// Top unpatched CVEs across devices
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| summarize DeviceCount = dcount(DeviceId) by CveId, VulnerabilitySeverityLevel
| where VulnerabilitySeverityLevel == "Critical"
| order by DeviceCount desc
| take 15
```

**Expected Time**: ~3-5 minutes (with MCP App visualizations)

---

### Pattern 6: Active Response & Containment

**When to use**: Confirmed compromise, device isolation, account lockdown

**Prompt to Copilot**:
```
Isolate device WORKSTATION-01 and disable the compromised user account
```

**What happens** (via `defender-response` skill):
1. Confirms action with analyst (never auto-executes destructive actions)
2. Isolates device via Defender API
3. Marks user compromised in Entra ID
4. Revokes all active sessions/tokens
5. Logs all actions taken with timestamps

**Expected Time**: ~1-2 minutes (after analyst confirmation)

---

### Pattern 7: IOC Management & Bulk Enrichment

**When to use**: Post-investigation IOC tracking, threat intel feeds, watchlist updates

**Prompt to Copilot**:
```
Extract all IOCs from investigation_jdoe_2026-01-15.json and enrich them
```

**What happens** (via `ioc-management` skill):
1. Parses investigation JSON for IPs, domains, file hashes, URLs
2. Deduplicates and classifies IOC types
3. Enriches via AbuseIPDB, IPInfo, VPNapi, Shodan, VirusTotal
4. Exports to STIX format for SIEM integration

---

## 🔍 Essential KQL Patterns

### Get Recent Sign-ins
```kql
union isfuzzy=true SigninLogs, AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where UserPrincipalName =~ '<UPN>'
| take 100
```

### Find Security Incidents for User
```kql
// Requires: User Object ID + Windows SID from Graph API
let targetUserId = "<USER_OBJECT_ID>";
let targetSid = "<WINDOWS_SID>";

SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where Entities has targetUserId or Entities has targetSid
```

### Check Anomalies
```kql
Signinlogs_Anomalies_KQL_CL
| where DetectedDateTime between (datetime(<Start>) .. datetime(<End>))
| where UserPrincipalName =~ '<UPN>'
| order by DetectedDateTime desc
```

### Extract IPs for Enrichment
```kql
union isfuzzy=true SigninLogs, AADNonInteractiveUserSignInLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where UserPrincipalName =~ '<UPN>'
| summarize SignInCount = count() by IPAddress
| order by SignInCount desc
| take 15
```

## 📅 Date Range Calculator

**Current Date Context**: Always verify current date before calculating ranges!

### Rule 1: Real-Time/Recent Searches
**Use case**: "Last 7 days", "Recent activity", "Current"

**Formula**: 
- Start: Current date - X days
- End: Current date + 2 days

**Example** (Today = Jan 15, 2026):
- Last 7 days: `datetime(2026-01-08)` to `datetime(2026-01-17)`

### Rule 2: Historical Searches
**Use case**: "From Jan 1 to Jan 5", user-specified dates

**Formula**:
- Start: User's start date
- End: User's end date + 1 day

**Example**:
- Jan 1-5: `datetime(2026-01-01)` to `datetime(2026-01-06)`

**Why +1 or +2?** `datetime(2026-01-15)` = Jan 15 00:00:00 (midnight). Without adjustment, you miss up to 48 hours of data due to timezone offset.

## 📝 Report Naming Conventions

**Always follow these patterns**:

| Report Type | Pattern | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Investigation | `investigation_<user>_YYYY-MM-DD.{json,html}` | `investigation_jdoe_2026-01-15.html` |
| Incident | `incident_report_<id>_YYYY-MM-DD.html` | `incident_report_41398_2026-01-15.html` |
| Executive | `executive_report_YYYY-MM-DD.html` | `executive_report_2026-01-15.html` |
| IP Enrichment | `ip_enrichment_<count>_ips_YYYY-MM-DD.json` | `ip_enrichment_15_ips_2026-01-15.json` |

**Rules**:
- Lowercase prefixes
- Underscores (_) as separators
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)
- UPN prefix: extract before @ symbol, lowercase
- All reports in `reports/` directory

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "No results returned from query"

**Possible Causes**:
1. Date range too narrow (check +2 day rule)
2. UPN case sensitivity (use `=~` operator)
3. User has no activity in time range
4. Wrong workspace ID

**Solution**: Start with `| take 1` to verify data exists, then expand query

---

### Issue: "SessionId is empty"

**Cause**: Non-interactive sign-ins don't populate SessionId

**Solution**: Use time-window correlation (±5 minutes) or DeviceId matching

---

### Issue: "Investigation JSON already exists, but Copilot re-queries anyway"

**Cause**: Copilot didn't check files first

**Solution**: Remind Copilot: "Check if investigation JSON exists for <user> before querying"

---

### Issue: "IP enrichment takes too long"

**Cause**: External API rate limits

**Solutions**:
1. Use batch queries (Query 11 - Threat Intel) instead of per-IP lookups
2. Check if data already exists in investigation JSON
3. Prioritize IPs using Query 1 (top 15 selection)

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Analysts**:
1. Always check Investigation Guide samples before writing custom KQL
2. Document empty results (negative evidence is evidence!)
3. Track investigation time to build efficiency
4. Use `project` early in queries to reduce data volume

**For AI-Assisted Investigations**:
1. Always verify current date from context before date calculations
2. Check for existing JSON files before re-querying
3. Read `ip_enrichment` array from JSON for IP context
4. Follow SessionId workflow for authentication anomalies (don't improvise!)

**For Both**:
1. Use parallel query execution when possible
2. Save useful queries to `queries/custom/` folder
3. Keep Investigation Guide open in second monitor
4. Export findings to CSV for offline analysis
