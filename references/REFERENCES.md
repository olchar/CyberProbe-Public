## 6. AI Attacks, Threats & Adversarial Techniques

A primer on how adversaries target AI/ML systems, LLM-powered applications, and AI-assisted security tools — and the taxonomies used to classify these threats.

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025) — Full Breakdown

The [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) is the industry-standard risk catalog for systems that integrate large language models. Every risk below is relevant to AI-assisted security tools like CyberProbe.

| Rank | Risk | Description | Attack Example | Reference |
|------|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **LLM01** | Prompt Injection | Attacker manipulates LLM behavior through crafted input — either directly (user prompt) or indirectly (poisoned tool output) | Malicious KQL result containing instructions that trick the agent into exfiltrating data | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM02** | Insecure Output Handling | LLM output used in downstream systems without validation (SQL injection, XSS via generated content) | Generated HTML report containing unescaped script tags from alert descriptions | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM03** | Training Data Poisoning | Compromised training data causes model to produce biased, incorrect, or malicious outputs | Poisoned threat intel feed causing false negatives on known-bad IPs | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM04** | Model Denial of Service | Crafted inputs designed to exhaust model resources or cause degraded performance | Recursive prompt patterns that consume all available tokens without useful output | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM05** | Supply Chain Vulnerabilities | Compromised model weights, plugins, datasets, or dependencies | Malicious MCP server or poisoned skill file injecting unauthorized tool calls | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM06** | Sensitive Information Disclosure | Model reveals PII, secrets, API keys, or internal system details in outputs | Agent leaking tenant IDs, UPNs, or API keys in generated investigation reports | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM07** | Insecure Plugin Design | Plugins/tools accept unsafe input without validation, enabling injection or privilege escalation | MCP tool executing unvalidated KQL from user input without parameterization | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM08** | Excessive Agency | LLM granted too many capabilities or permissions, enabling unintended destructive actions | Agent autonomously isolating devices or blocking users without analyst confirmation | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM09** | Overreliance | Humans blindly trusting LLM output without verification, leading to missed threats or false confidence | SOC analyst closing an incident based solely on AI summary without reviewing raw evidence | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |
| **LLM10** | Model Theft | Unauthorized access to proprietary model weights, fine-tuned data, or system prompts | Exfiltration of custom investigation skill definitions or copilot-instructions.md | https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/ |

### AI Attack Patterns Relevant to Security Operations

Attack patterns that specifically target AI-assisted security investigation workflows:

| Attack Pattern | Description | SOC Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Indirect Prompt Injection** | Adversary plants instructions in data sources (alert descriptions, email subjects, hostname fields) that are ingested by the AI agent | Agent may skip investigating an entity, generate misleading report, or execute unintended actions | Input sanitization, prompt injection detection in tool outputs, evidence-based analysis rules |
| **Tool Poisoning** | Compromised MCP server returns manipulated data designed to alter agent behavior | False investigation conclusions, missed threats, fabricated evidence | Tool output validation, cross-referencing multiple sources, human-in-the-loop for critical decisions |
| **Adversarial Evasion** | Attacker crafts activity patterns designed to fall below AI detection thresholds | SOC AI tools fail to flag genuinely malicious behavior | Ensemble detection (combine AI + rule-based), threshold tuning, continuous model evaluation |
| **Data Poisoning via Feedback Loops** | Attacker contaminates training/fine-tuning data through manipulated incident classifications | Model learns incorrect patterns, future investigations degrade in quality | Audit classification decisions, protected validation sets, anomaly detection on feedback data |
| **Model Extraction** | Attacker queries the AI system systematically to reverse-engineer its detection logic | Adversary learns to evade specific detection rules or investigation patterns | Rate limiting, query pattern monitoring, model watermarking |
| **Copilot Prompt Exfiltration** | Attacker attempts to extract system instructions, skill definitions, or custom rules | Reveals investigation methodology, tool access patterns, and defensive blind spots | Instruction-level guardrails, output filtering, prompt leak detection |
| **Hallucination Exploitation** | Attacker relies on known AI tendency to fabricate plausible-sounding data | Analyst acts on non-existent evidence, false IOCs contaminate threat intel feeds | Evidence-based analysis (CyberProbe's global rule), mandatory source citation, human verification |
