.SYNOPSIS
    Promote curated commits from the private dev repo (origin) to the public repo (public).

.DESCRIPTION
    Safety workflow for the two-repo setup:
      - origin = olchar/CyberProbe-Dev (PRIVATE, daily work)
      - public = olchar/CyberProbe     (PUBLIC, curated releases only)

    This script:
      1. Confirms the local tree is clean.
      2. Shows commits that are in local main but NOT yet in public/main.
      3. Runs a PII scan against those commits (blocks promotion if findings).
      4. Asks for explicit confirmation.
      5. Fast-forwards push to public/main.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh ./scripts/promote-to-public.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Dry run - show what WOULD be promoted, no push
    pwsh ./scripts/promote-to-public.ps1 -DryRun
